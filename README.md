# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems using JavaScript.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. The problems range in difficulty and cover various mathematical concepts. The goal is to solve as many problems as possible using programming and mathematical skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem has its own JavaScript file named according to the problem number, e.g., `problem1.js`.
- The solutions are implemented using JavaScript.
- The `utils.js` file contains utility functions that can be helpful for solving the problems.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Simply navigate to the project folder and run the following command:


Replace `X` with the problem number you want to run.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have alternative solutions or improvements for existing solutions, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your solutions are well-documented and adhere to best practices.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the purpose of Project Euler is to challenge and develop your skills in problem-solving and programming. While sharing and discussing solutions is encouraged, it is essential to respect the spirit of the project by not simply copying and pasting solutions without understanding them.
